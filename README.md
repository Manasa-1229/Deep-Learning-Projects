## Project Descriptions

### 1. American Sign Language Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using deep learning. The goal is to accurately identify different ASL signs from images or video streams. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract features from the images and classify them into corresponding ASL signs.

- **Tools & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Key Features**: Image preprocessing, CNN architecture, model training, and evaluation.

### 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project involves detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, and the project explores various techniques to handle this imbalance, including undersampling, oversampling, and advanced algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost.

- **Tools & Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**: Data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation with a focus on precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics.

### 3. Emotion Detection

This project aims to develop a model that can accurately detect emotions from facial images. Using the RAF Face Database, different deep learning models are trained to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, etc. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using CNNs, and model evaluation.

- **Tools & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Key Features**: Data augmentation, CNN architecture, emotion classification, model evaluation.

### 4. House Price Prediction

In this project, various regression techniques are applied to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project compares multiple models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest.

- **Tools & Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**: Feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison.

### 5. LSTM for Text and Speech

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text and speech processing tasks. Applications include converting speech to text, generating stories, and text-to-speech conversion.

- **Tools & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, SpeechRecognition
- **Key Features**: LSTM architecture, text generation, speech recognition, model training and evaluation.

### 6. Real and Fake Face Detection

This project focuses on distinguishing between real and fake facial images using deep learning models. Techniques like EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG16 are applied to create robust models for this classification task.

- **Tools & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Key Features**: Data preprocessing, CNN architectures, model training, and evaluation.
